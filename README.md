# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description
In this project, the developer(s) created a password generator through JavaScript. This password generator uses prompts to determine the parameters for the password to be generated.
The user decides how long the generated password is (no less than 8 characters, and no more than 128 characters), the use of uppercase characters, the use of numbers, and the use of special characters. When the user clicks on the "Generate" button, the password generator will display the prompts and create a random password that satisfies the criteria established by the user.
